<!-- TODO:

- Display an optimized image from /assets/images
- Fallback in the visual editor to an image from /static/fallback-images/
- Copy images from assets/images to static/fallback-images
- Make the image address come from templating
- Add to docs about this partial
- - Made for CC cause
- - - visual editor resources.Get dont work so good
- - - we have a prebuild we can copy the images from assets to static in
- - - maybe we can have a way to only copy the images over in a dev/staging env
- - - the width should be set to max width, so for the blog post on Hugo starter around 700px is good
- - - - the og image is 3000px (~355kb) and the optimized is 700px (~less idk) and the max width the image will ever be used for is 656px 

Questions:
- Does having the fallback images in the static folder increase load times if we don't reference them on the page?
